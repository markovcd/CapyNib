# Capynib

Capynib is a Google Keep-style notes app for Android that keeps notes on the device and syncs them to a [memos](https://usememos.com) server as you type. See [README.md](README.md) for the build and run
commands, `docs/adr/` for the decisions behind the design, and
[docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md) for the one word each thing is called by.

- **The gate:** `./gate.sh`: builds the app and runs every test, including sync against a real memos server, inside a pinned Android SDK container (needs Docker). It is the truth; a local run can be green about code it skipped.
- **Fast loop:** `./gradlew :core:test --tests '*SyncEngineTest'` (any module, any class). With a memos server running (`docker run -d -p 5230:5230 neosmemo/memos:stable`), set `MEMOS_TEST_URL=http://localhost:5230` to include the live-server tests; without it they skip and say so. Machines that cannot reach Google's Maven repository add `-Pcapynib.jvmOnly=true` to build only `core` and `cli`.
- **TODO.md** lists work asked for and not yet started. Add to it when the user says "add to the todo", and take an item off in the commit that lands it. A plan, an audit or an out-of-scope problem too long for a line is written up in [docs/handoff/](docs/handoff/README.md) and linked from its item.

Standing rules are in `docs/agents/rules/`. They apply to nearly every task, so read all of them before starting; Claude Code imports them through the paths below:

- @docs/agents/rules/git-workflow.md — declarative commit subjects, squash unpushed churn, never sweep up another session's uncommitted work.
- @docs/agents/rules/code-style.md — new code is indistinguishable from the file it lands in; failures are values; one place knows a thing.
- @docs/agents/rules/testing.md — a behavior change lands with a test that failed before it; test names state the rule.
- @docs/agents/rules/honest-tests.md — a failing test is fixed by fixing the code, never by weakening, skipping or special-casing the test.
- @docs/agents/rules/security.md — secrets stay out of everything; outside input is checked where it enters; a check is never loosened to make something work.
- @docs/agents/rules/ci-cd.md — land small and often, a red mainline is fixed before anything else, and the mainline is always releasable.
- @docs/agents/rules/pipeline.md — CI runs the gate itself; workflows pinned, least-permission and timed out; a release is one script, refuses before moving anything, and ships signed.
- @docs/agents/rules/saved-data.md — what was written stays readable; a format change carries its migration and a test that loads the old shape.
- @docs/agents/rules/one-type-per-file.md — one top-level type per file, named for it; split a file that holds several whenever a change touches it.
- @docs/agents/rules/prose-style.md — succinct comments that never narrate history.
- @docs/agents/rules/terminology.md — when the user says a word the glossary rules out, correct it in one line.
- @docs/agents/rules/agent-drivability.md — drivability by an agent comes first; a hack needed to get something done is a feature to propose.
- @docs/agents/rules/propose-refactors.md — code that has gone untidy or ballooned is a refactor to propose, after the task and outside its commit.
- @docs/agents/rules/working-habits.md — stop when the work is done, report failure plainly, verify at the cheapest level that proves it.

Task-specific know-how is in `.claude/skills/`, loaded when a skill's description matches the task:

- `tests`: rank a run by duration, treat an unexplained slow test as a defect, run narrow while iterating and everything once per commit, write feature scenarios as requirements.
- `dependencies`: check packages and the toolchain before anything big; take cheap upgrades, hand off expensive ones.
- `adrs`: check `docs/adr/` before proposing a refactor; rewrite a day-old ADR in place; number a new ADR at commit time.
- `changelog`: what CHANGELOG.md may contain.
- `docs-in-step`: a change to anything the docs or site describe updates them in the same commit.
- `performance`: how to measure without fooling yourself.
- `running-the-app`: before launching the real app, wait for any other instance; drive only the process you started.

Commands in `.claude/commands/` are run by name: `/bughunt` hunts for bugs, confirms each as a failing test, fixes it, and files the test where it belongs.

## Where things are

- `core/`: plain Kotlin, no Android. The note model and memo format (`note/`), the SQLite store (`store/`, schema in `src/main/sqldelight`), the memos client (`memos/`), sync (`sync/`), and the logic behind the screens (`board/`, `editor/`). Most behavior is tested here.
- `cli/`: the `capynib` command line over `core`, for driving notes and sync without a phone (`./gradlew :cli:run --args='list --json'`).
- `app/`: the Android app (Jetpack Compose). Screens are thin over `core`; theme tokens are in `app/src/main/kotlin/.../ui/theme/`.
- `docs/adr/`: decisions. `docs/design-handoff.md`: what a designer needs to restyle the app.
